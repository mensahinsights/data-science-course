# Data-Science-Course

For this Data Science Course capstone project, I investigate how weather conditions, area type (urban vs. rural), and traffic congestion impact Amazon delivery times. 

By sourcing a deliver attribute relevant dataset, I this clean and explore the data, develop visualizations to identify key trends, and create a numerical model to predict delivery times. 

I apply model validation techniques and provide explanatory visuals to highlight insights, aiming to understand how these factors contribute to delivery delays.
