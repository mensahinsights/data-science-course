# Amazon Delivery Performance Analytics ðŸ“¦

Understanding the factors that drive delivery performance in modern logistics through data science.

## Project Overview

This comprehensive analysis examines how environmental and geographical factors impact Amazon delivery times. Using machine learning techniques, I've built a predictive model that identifies the key drivers behind delivery delays, providing actionable insights for logistics optimisation.

**Key Question**: How do weather conditions, urban versus rural locations, and traffic patterns affect delivery performance?

## What You'll Find Here

### **Problem Definition**
Clear hypothesis development around delivery time factors and their business impact

### **Data Engineering** 
Robust data sourcing, cleaning, and preprocessing workflows that handle real-world data challenges

### **Exploratory Analysis**
Interactive visualisations and statistical analysis revealing hidden patterns in delivery performance

### **Predictive Modelling**
Machine learning pipeline development with feature engineering and model selection

### **Model Validation**
Rigorous testing methodologies ensuring model reliability and generalisability

### **Business Insights**
Data-driven recommendations with clear visualisations explaining the 'why' behind the findings

### **Strategic Recommendations**
Actionable next steps and implementation roadmap for delivery optimisation

## Technical Approach

Built entirely in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, this project demonstrates end-to-end data science capabilities from initial hypothesis through to deployment-ready insights. The analysis combines statistical rigour with clear business storytelling.

## Impact & Applications

The methodologies and insights developed here are directly applicable to:
- Supply chain optimisation
- Logistics planning
- Operational efficiency improvements
- Customer experience enhancement
